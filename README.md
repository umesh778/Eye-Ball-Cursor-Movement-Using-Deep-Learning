Created a custom dataset of face images for training. The images are not uploaded as it is a large data set which requires huge memory. 
Utilized Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and crop eye images from the face dataset. 
Developed and trained a deep learning model on the cropped eye images. 
Implemented real-time cursor movement control using the trained model. 
Plotted six points around the eye and calculated the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) for click detection. 
Achieved left and right mouse clicks based on EAR for right and left eye blinks
